# falling-blocks
A game about blocks falling all over the place

## Dependencies
* curses

## How to play
Start the game (trust me, it works):
```
perl game.py
```

Move the currently falling block sideways with A and D, stop the game with Q. That's all for now, the game is nowhere near feature-completeness.
